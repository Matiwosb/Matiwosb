- My name is Matiwos Birbo. 
I am currently a sophomore student at the University of Memphis majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 
I am an aspiring software engineer who has graduated from a coding Bootcamp and is now applying his technological skills
towards research, personal projects, and teaching underrepresented, disadvantaged minority children and teenagers about robotics, 
video game development, web developments, and other computer science-based concepts. I am currently seeking an internship where I 
can apply my current skill sets and gain new skills. If you have any coding projects or internship opportunities available for me, 
please do not hesitate to reach out to me!
