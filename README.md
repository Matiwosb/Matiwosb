- My name is Matiwos Birbo. I am an aspiring software engineer who has graduated from a coding bootcamp and the University of Memphis. I am also now applying my technological skills towards research, personal projects, and teaching underrepresented, disadvantaged minority children and teenagers about robotics, video game development, web development, and other computer science-based concepts. I am currently seeking a part-time job and internship where I can apply my current skill sets and gain new skills. If you have any coding projects, part-time jobs, or internship opportunities available for me, please do not hesitate to reach out to me!
